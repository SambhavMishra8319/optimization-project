Longest Common Subsequence (Sambhav Mishra - 23BDS050)
Project Title: Longest Common Subsequence between Wild-type and Mutated mRNA Sequences

Description:
This project identifies the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between wild-type and mutated mRNA sequences, providing insights into genetic variations.

Methodology:

Input Files: Reads the sequences from wild-type and mutated mRNA text files.
Dynamic Programming Table: Builds a 2D table to find the LCS.
Backtracking: Reconstructs the LCS with indices in both sequences.
Output: Saves LCS and indices in an output file, highlighting the LCS within the sequences.
Results:
The program successfully finds the LCS, useful for bioinformatics research by showing sequence similarities.

Conclusion:
The approach efficiently identifies the LCS, providing insights into genetic similarity. Future work could include handling larger datasets and improved visualization.

Datasets:

Mutated APOE
Wild-type APOE
Traveling Salesman Problem (Sundaram - 23BDS060)
Project Title: Optimal Pathfinding in Graphs Using the Traveling Salesman Problem

Description:
This project tackles the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a classic optimization problem. The goal is to find the shortest possible route visiting each node in a graph exactly once and returning to the start.

Methodology:

Graph Input: Takes a weighted graph representing cities and distances.
Algorithm Implementation: Uses approaches like brute-force, dynamic programming, or heuristics to compute optimal routes.
Output: Displays the optimal route and its total cost, saved for further analysis.
Results:
The TSP implementation identifies efficient routes, minimizing travel distances for the given graph data.

Conclusion:
The project demonstrates TSP's potential to solve routing problems. Future improvements could explore additional optimization techniques for larger datasets.
