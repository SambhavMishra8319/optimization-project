Longest Common Subsequence (Sambhav Mishra - 23BDS050)<br>
Project Title: Longest Common Subsequence between Wild-type and Mutated mRNA Sequences<br>

Description:<br>
This project identifies the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between wild-type and mutated mRNA sequences, providing insights into genetic variations.<br>

Methodology:<br>

Input Files: Reads the sequences from wild-type and mutated mRNA text files.<br>
Dynamic Programming Table: Builds a 2D table to find the LCS.<br>
Backtracking: Reconstructs the LCS with indices in both sequences.<br>
Output: Saves LCS and indices in an output file, highlighting the LCS within the sequences.<br>
Results:<br>
The program successfully finds the LCS, useful for bioinformatics research by showing sequence similarities.<br>

Conclusion:<br>
The approach efficiently identifies the LCS, providing insights into genetic similarity. Future work could include handling larger datasets and improved visualization.<br>

Traveling Salesman Problem (Sundaram - 23BDS060)<br>
Project Title: Optimal Pathfinding in Graphs Using the Traveling Salesman Problem<br>

Description:<br>
This project tackles the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a classic optimization problem. The goal is to find the shortest possible route visiting each node in a graph exactly once and returning to the start.<br>
dataset:<br>
Methodology:<br>

Graph Input: Takes a weighted graph representing cities and distances.<br>
Algorithm Implementation: Uses approaches like brute-force, dynamic programming, or heuristics to compute optimal routes.<br>
Output: Displays the optimal route and its total cost, saved for further analysis.<br>
Results:<br>
The TSP implementation identifies efficient routes, minimizing travel distances for the given graph data.
<br>
Conclusion:<br>
The project demonstrates TSP's potential to solve routing problems. Future improvements could explore additional optimization techniques for larger datasets.<br>
